## Knowledge Prerequisites
Before attempting to write a Discord bot, you should be familiar with the concepts of [Object Oriented Programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [the C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/), and [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).

If you're brand new to C#, or programming in general, this library may prove difficult for you to use.</br>
Fortunately, there are resources that can help you get started with the language!

An excellent tutorial series to go through would be [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/CSharp-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners) by Bob Tabor.
His videos go through all the basics, from setting up your development environment up to some of the more advanced concepts.
If you're not sure what to do first, Bob's tutorial series should be your starting point!

## Supported .NET Implementations
DisCatSharp 10.X and higher target directly .NET 6.

## Getting Started
If you're writing a Discord bot for the first time, you'll want to start with *[creating a bot account](xref:basics_bot_account)*.</br>
Otherwise, if you have a bot account already, start off with the *[writing your first bot](xref:basics_first_bot)* article.</br>

Once you're up and running, feel free to browse through the [API Documentation](/api/index.html)!
